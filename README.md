# Disaster-Tweets-NLP
Analyzing disaster tweets using machine learning as part of the disaster tweets NLP kaggle competition. 
This is a foray into natural language processing.
The datafiles were gathered from the Kaggle API.


My goal is to classify potentially ambiguous tweets as either corresponding to disasters or not.
Many keywords can confound such a judgement, like "ablaze" for instance.
We've created an LSTM model, and show that it performs better than the adaboost model.
We also explore whether various symbols identified in the exploratory data analysis would result in better classification.

Hopefully I can continue this and maybe score close to the top.
